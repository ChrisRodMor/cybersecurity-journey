# Cybersecurity Journey 🛡️💻

This repository documents my learning path in **cybersecurity**, with a focus on
**offensive security**, **ethical hacking**, and **penetration testing**.

It serves as a public knowledge base and progress log where I track what I learn,
practice, and build as I grow in the field.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Document my cybersecurity learning journey from the ground up
- Reinforce concepts through clear and concise technical notes
- Track progress across courses and hands-on labs
- Build a public portfolio that reflects real learning, not just certificates

---

## 📚 Current Focus

- Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Coursera)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Networking and Linux basics
- Offensive security mindset
- Hands-on labs and experimentation

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Learn the theory
- Break things in controlled environments
- Understand **why** systems break
- Document mistakes and lessons learned
- Iterate and improve

I strongly prefer **hands-on learning** over passive content.
